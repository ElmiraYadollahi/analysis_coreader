This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see .

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(width=90)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE, tidy = TRUE, size="small")
```

# Loading Data
Let's load data. The first step is to read a CSV file into a dataframe, which is the data structure used by R to store data.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE}

# Uncomment and run if these packages are not installed yet.
# install.packages("gdata")
# install.packages("gplots")

library(gdata) # reorder
library(gplots) # plotmeans
library(ggfortify) # regression diagnostics
library(plyr) # ddply

```


```{r echo=TRUE}
# TODO: Adapt the path to your own installation
# Set the working directory
setwd("/home/yadollah/Dropbox/2.PhD/Experiment_Geneve/Analysis/Categorizaton/")

# Read a csv file (header = T signals that the first line of the file contains the names of the variables)
# the <- operator assigns the result of read.csv to the variable moocs 
# moocs is a dataframe, similar to an excel worksheet.

# Open day 1 data for within subject study
D1 <- read.csv(file="all_correction_status_within.csv", header = T)



# Open day 2 data for within subject study

D2 <- read.csv(file="all_correction_status_Day2_within.csv", header = T)


```


```{r}
# prints the first rows of the dataframe. Useful to check if the import has worked. We see that there are many missing values signaled by "NA" == Not Available
head(D1)
head(D2)
```


```{r}
# Treat the data


```





```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
